Welcome to the TBAC packages directory
--------------------------------------

	TBAC is a RSBAC REG policy about timed based access control.


Installation
============

	Compilation require rsbac kernel header, so rsbac-admin tools must
	have been installed.

	$ make
	$ make build
	$ sudo make install


Usage
=====

	Right now, tbac only support file's attributes on a single device,
	and you must set this parameter during module loading.
	You need minor and major number of selected device. [1]

	You should read the SPECS file to understand how it works.

	First load the tbac module:
		$ sudo modprobe tbac_minor_device=8 tbac_major_device=3

	Then You can check everything goes right by looking at
	/proc/rsbac-info/tbac

	The best way to play with it is to use the rsbac_tbac_menu.py.
	However commandline tools are also provided: 
		tbac_[gs]et_conf to set working hours // a oneshot holiday 
		tbac_[gs]et_attr_fd to set fd's attributes


Known CAVEATS
=============

	TBAC being a REG module, it does not benefits from common RSBAC attributes
	workflow, meaning no:
		* transactions
		* attributes inheritance (every files must be tagged)

	Supporting every mounted devices could be done without much that work.

[1] To get filesystem under device minor/major you can use 'stat':

$ stat --printf="%D\n" /home 
808

/home device's minor is 08, major is 8

[1] or you can look at the mounted devices in dev with 'ls':

$ ls -l /dev/sda8
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 8 2009-10-15 18:35 /dev/sda8
                       ^  ^
		       \---\--- those number are major and minor
