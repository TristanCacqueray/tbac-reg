Welcome to the TBAC packages directory
--------------------------------------

TBAC is a RSBAC REG policy about timed based access control.
This project is in developpement.

Currently available:

* REG module active for one device
* Tkinter administration interface


Installation
------------

Compilation require rsbac kernel header, so rsbac-admin tools must
have been installed.

$ make
$ make build
$ sudo make install

Make sure environment contain:

* */usr/local/lib* is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in /etc/ld.so.conf / ldconfig
* */usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages* in PYTHONPATH


Usage
-----

Right now, tbac only support file's attributes on a single device,
and you must set this parameter during module loading.
You need minor and major number of selected device. [1]

You should read the SPECS file to understand how it works.

First load the tbac module:
	$ sudo modprobe tbac tbac_root_device_major=X tbac_root_device_minor=Y

Then You can check everything goes right by looking at
	/proc/rsbac-info/tbac

The best way to play with it is to use the rsbac_tbac_menu.py.
However commandline tools are also provided:
	tbac_[gs]et_conf to set working hours // a oneshot holiday
	tbac_[gs]et_attr_fd to set fd's attributes


Known CAVEATS
-------------

TBAC being a REG module, it does not benefits from common RSBAC attributes
workflow, meaning:
	* no transactions
	* no attributes inheritance (every files must be tagged)

Supporting every mounted devices could be done without much that work.


Directores layouts
------------------

This package contains:

main:
|->/src:                the reg module sources
|->/headers:            the tbac include files
|->/libs:               userland library and its python binding
\->/tools:              administration commands and a fancy Tk menu in python



[1] To get filesystem under device minor/major you can use 'stat':

$ stat --printf="%D\n" /home 
805

/home device's major is 08, minor ir 05

[1] or you can look at the mounted devices in dev with 'ls':

$ ls -l /dev/sda8
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 5 2009-10-15 18:35 /dev/sda5
                       ^  ^
                       \---\--- those number are major and minor
